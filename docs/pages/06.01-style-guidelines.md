# Style Guidelines for Development

### Elyra Canvas styling guidelines
- Used the `data-id` attribute on inputs to be used for automated tests.  Format for Common Properties should be `properties-`
- **className** format format for Common Properties should be `properties-`
- Limit the use of html(DOM) ids
- Minimum inline styling.  This allows for consumers to easily override styling.
- scss/sass styling should be added to the component's folder
- No `important!` in styling
- Use variables for all colors(preferably from carbon)
