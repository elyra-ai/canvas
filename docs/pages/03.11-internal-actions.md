# Internal common-canvas actions

Internal actions can be generated by the user either:

* Clicking a toolbar button or
* Clicking an option in a context menu or context toolbar or
* Pressing keyboard shortcut key(s) or
* Performing direct manipulation like dragging one or more objects on the canvas

Some internal actions can be generated in multiple different ways. For example, the `deleteSelectedObjects` action can be generated by the user:

* Clicking the trash can icon in the toolbar or
* Pressing the Delete key or
* Clicking the Delete option in a context menu or context toolbar.

In each case, the action generates a call to the [beforeEditActionHandler](03.03.02-before-edit-action-handler.md) callback and then the [editActionHandler](03.03.03-edit-action-handler.md) callback. For each callback, the `editType` field of the first parameter will be set to one of the actions listed below.

These are the intenal actions:
