# Internal common-canvas actions

Internal actions can be generated by the user either:

* Clicking a toolbar button
* Clicking an option in a context menu or context toobar
* Pressing a keyboard short cut key(s)
* Doing some direct manipulation like dragging one or more objects

Occassionally, actions can be generated internally by common canvas but this is quite rare.
Some actions can be generated from different sources. For example, the "deleteSelectedObjects" action can be generated by the user:

* Clicking the trash can icon in the toolbar or
* Pressing the Delete key
* Clicking the Delete option in a context menu.

In each case, the action causes the [editActionHandler](03.03.03-edit-action-handler.md) callback to be called with the `editType` field of the first parameter passed in to be set to one of the actions listed below.

These are the intenal actions:
