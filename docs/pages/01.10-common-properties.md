# Common Properties

[Common Properties](04-common-properties.md) is a React object that allows the application to display a set of controls (radio buttons, text entry areas, drop down lists, sliders, tables, etc) to present the properties of a node to the user. Common Properties supports the most commonly used UI components and also allows custom components to be added into its visual output.

Common Properties takes a Javascript (JSON) object, that complies with the [Paramater Definition](https://github.com/elyra-ai/pipeline-schemas/tree/main/common-canvas/parameter-defs) schema, and some configuration objects as props.

Traditionally, the right-flyout is used to display properties but the application can choose to display them elsewhere. The UI elements displayed by Common Properties comply with the Carbon design language.

For more details and examples of the components/controls supported by Common Properties see the [Common Properties Components](https://elyra-canvas-test-harness.u20youmx4sm.us-south.codeengine.appdomain.cloud/#/properties) page.

Here's an example of the type of output a `<CommonProperties>` React object can produce. This is from the IBM SPSS Modler application:
