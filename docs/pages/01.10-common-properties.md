# Common Properties

[Common Properties](04-common-properties.md) allows the application to display a set of controls (radio buttons, text entry areas, drop down lists, sliders, tables, etc) to present the properties of a node to the user.  Traditionally, the right-flyout is used to display node properties. The UI elements displayed by Common Properties comply with the Carbon design language.

Common Properties takes a Javascript (JSON) object and some configuration objects as input. Common properties supports the most commonly used UI components and also allows custom components to be added into its visual output.
