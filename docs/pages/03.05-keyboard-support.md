## Keyboard support

Common canvas supports a number of keyboard interactions as follows:

### When focus is in the flow editor

|Keyboard Shortcut|Action|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Ctrl/Cmnd + a|selectAll|Select All objects
|delete|deleteSelectedObjects|Delete currently selected objects|
|Ctrl/Cmnd + x|cut|Cut selected objects to the clipboard|
|Ctrl/Cmnd + c|copy|Copy selected objects to the clipboard|
|Ctrl/Cmnd + v|paste|Paste objects from the clipboard. If the mouse cursor is over <br>the canvas, objects will be pasted at the cursor position or, <br>if not, at a default position|
|Ctrl/Cmnd + z|undo|Undo last command|
|Ctrl/Cmnd + Shift + z|redo|Redo last undone command|
|Ctrl/Cmnd + y|redo|Redo last undone command|

### When focus is on a palette node

|Keyboard Shortcut|Action|Description|
|---|---|---|
|space bar|createNodeAttachLinks |Adds the node to the canvas and links it to existing node on canvas. Same as double clicking the node.


Your application can disable any or all of these actions by providing the [keyboard config object](03.02.05-keyboard-config.md) to the CommonCanvas react component.

When any of the shortcut keys are pressed the common-canvas object model will be updated and then the [editActionHandler](03.03-callbacks.md#editactionhandler) callback will be called with the `data.editType` parameter set to the action above and the `data.editSource` parameter set to "keyboard".
