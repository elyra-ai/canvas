# Keyboard support

Common Canvas supports a number of keyboard interactions as described below. Some keyboard shortcuts are only available if the config field `enableKeyboardNavigation` is set to `true`.  Some others, shown with an asterisk below are always availble.


## Flow Editoor

### When focus is in the flow editor background

|Keyboard Shortcut|Action|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Meta + a|selectAll|Selects alll objects|
|Meta  + Shift + a|deselectAll|Deselects all objects|
|delete|deleteSelectedObjects|Delete currently selected objects|
|Meta + x|cut|Cut selected objects to the clipboard|
|Meta + c|copy|Copy selected objects to the clipboard|
|Meta + v|paste|Paste objects from the clipboard. If the mouse cursor is over <br>the canvas, objects will be pasted at the cursor position or, <br>if not, at a default position|
|Meta + z|undo|Undo last command|
|Meta + Shift + z|redo|Redo last undone command|
|Meta + y|redo|Redo last undone command|

Your application can disable any or all of these actions by providing the [keyboard config object](03.02.05-keyboard-config.md) to the CommonCanvas React component.

When any of the shortcut keys are pressed the common-canvas object model will be updated and then the [editActionHandler](03.03-callbacks.md#editactionhandler) callback will be called with the `data.editType` parameter set to the action above and the `data.editSource` parameter set to "keyboard".
