# Keyboard support

Common Canvas supports a number of keyboard interactions as described below. Some keyboard shortcuts are only available if the config field `enableKeyboardNavigation` is set to `true` as indictaed above each table.

When any of the shortcut keys are pressed, if the shortcut has an action (listed below), Common Canvas will follow the same procedure as if the action was initiated from a context menu or from the canvas toolbar or by direct manipulation on the canvas. That is, it will: call the [beforeEditActionHandler](03.03.02-before-edit-action-handler.md) and the [editActionHandler](03.03.03-edit-action-handler.md) callbacks, with the `data.editType` parameter set to the action name and the `data.editSource` parameter set to "keyboard"; it will then update the object model with the change and refresh the flow editor display.

Note: In the tables below:

* "Meta" means either the Command key (⌘) on the Mac or, on Windows, the Windows key (⊞) or Control key (Ctrl).
* "Alt" means either the Option key (⌥) on the Mac or, on Windows, the Alternative key (Alt).

## Flow Editor
