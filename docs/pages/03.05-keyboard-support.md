## Keyboard support

Common Canvas supports a number of keyboard interactions as follows:

### When focus is in the flow editor

|Keyboard Shortcut|Action|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Ctrl/Cmnd + a|selectAll|Select All objects
|delete|deleteSelectedObjects|Delete currently selected objects|
|Ctrl/Cmnd + x|cut|Cut selected objects to the clipboard|
|Ctrl/Cmnd + c|copy|Copy selected objects to the clipboard|
|Ctrl/Cmnd + v|paste|Paste objects from the clipboard. If the mouse cursor is over <br>the canvas, objects will be pasted at the cursor position or, <br>if not, at a default position|
|Ctrl/Cmnd + z|undo|Undo last command|
|Ctrl/Cmnd + Shift + z|redo|Redo last undone command|
|Ctrl/Cmnd + y|redo|Redo last undone command|

Your application can disable any or all of these actions by providing the [keyboard config object](03.02.05-keyboard-config.md) to the CommonCanvas React component.

When any of the shortcut keys are pressed the common-canvas object model will be updated and then the [editActionHandler](03.03-callbacks.md#editactionhandler) callback will be called with the `data.editType` parameter set to the action above and the `data.editSource` parameter set to "keyboard".

### When focus is on a palette node
