# Nodes

## Introduction

Nodes displayed in the flow editor can represent data operations or other types of
operations for the type of flow the application displays. Nodes are joined together in a flow by links (edges). Association links can also join two nodes together (in a non-directional relationship) and nodes can be connected to comments with a comment link.

Nodes can be customized into and large number of different layouts depending on the needs of the application, as shown below:

<img src="../assets/cc-node2.png" width="300" />
<img src="../assets/cc-node3.png" width="240" />
<img src="../assets/cc-node4.png" width="115" />
<img src="../assets/cc-node5.png" width="280" />
<img src="../assets/cc-node6.png" width="120" />
<img src="../assets/cc-node7.png" width="290" />

Nodes are made up of a number of display elements such as:

* an image
* a label
* a background shape
* selection highlighting
* ellipsis icon (if context menus are enabled)
* ports
* decorations
