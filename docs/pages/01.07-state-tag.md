# State Tag

A State Tag is an optional pill-shaped object that can displays the state of the flow to the user. This can be either 'Locked' or 'Read-only'. By default, no state tag is shown.

The application can request a state tag be shown by setting the [enableStateTag](03.02.01-canvas-config.md/#enablestatetag) canvas config field.

When the State Tag is display it will show a tooltip, with an appropriate message, if the mouse cursor is hovered over it. The application can override the default message by implementing the [Tip Handler](03.03.06-tip-handler.md) callback.

!!! note
    It is the application's reponsibility for making the flow read-only. See the [Read Only or Locked Flows](03.09-read-only-or-locked-flows.md) page for more details.
