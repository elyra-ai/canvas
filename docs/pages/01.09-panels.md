# Panels

Common Canvas has three additional optional panels: top panel, bottom panel, right-flyout. These can be used by the application to display any additional content to the user such as logs or data previews or properties of selected objects. Traditionally, the right-flyout is used to display node properties.

The application can, optionally, use [Common Properties](01.10-common-properties.md) to display the controls for the properties of a node.

## Customizing content and display

The content and display of the panels is controlled by these six props of the `<CommonCanvas>` React object:

* showRightFlyout - a Boolean
* rightFlyoutContent - JSX object showing content

* showBottomPanel - a Boolean
* bottomPanelContent - JSX object showing content

* showTopPanel - a Boolean
* topPanelContent - JSX object showing content
