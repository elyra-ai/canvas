# Context menu

A context menu is a small window containing a list of options applicable to an object or set of selected objects.

A traditional context menu, like the one shown below,  will be displayed when [`enableContextToolbar`](03.02.01-canvas-config.md#enablecontexttoolbar) is set to `false` (or omitted) from the canvas config, and either:

* a right-click (or equivalent on a trackpad) is performed on a canvas object or the canvas background or
* `Control + click` is done on an obejct or
* the ellipsis icon (only shown for nodes) is clicked

## Populating the context menus

By default, Common Canvas will display appropriate context toolmenus for all flow editor canvas objects. The application can override or replace the default menus by implementing the [`contextMenuHandler`](03.03.01-context-menu-handler.md) callback.
