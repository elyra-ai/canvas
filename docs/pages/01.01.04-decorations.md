# Decorations

## Introduction

In common-canvas, nodes and links can be enhanced with decorations. A decoration is either:

* An image
* A label
* A shape (SVG path) or
* A JSX object

Decorations can be applied to a node or link in a [number of ways](03.04.01-decorations.md) and can be made interactable so when the user clicks on the decoration the [`decorationActionHandler`](03.03.05-decoration-action-handler.md) is called.

Here are some node decorations displayed by IBM's SPSS Modler application:

Here are some link decorations displayed by IBM's Data Stage application:

Note: The link labels and the small icons on the links are decoraitons and also the circle at the source of each link.
