# Nodes

## Introduction

Nodes displayed in the flow editor can represent data operations or other types of
operations for the type of flow the application displays. Nodes are joined together in a flow by links (edges). Association links can also join two nodes together (in a non-directional relationship) and nodes can be connetced to comments with a comment link.

Nodes can be customized into and large number of different layouts depending on the needs of the application, as shown below:

Nodes are made up of a number of display elements such as:

* a background shape
* selection highlighting
* ellipsis icon (if context menus are enabled)
