You can *optionally* provide callback listeners.  These will be called when the user interacts with the canvas.

These listeners are as follows:

* Context Menu Handler

* Edit Action Handler

* Before Edit Action Handler

* Layout Handler

* Decoration Action Handler

* Tip Handler

* ID Generator Handler

* Selection Change Handler

* Click Action Handler

* Action Label Handler
