# Installation

## NPM Install

You'll need to build your application with Elyra Canvas.

Use the command:
```sh
npm install @elyra/canvas --save-dev
```
or add this to your package.json file:

```
  "@elyra/canvas": "x.x.x"
```
where x.x.x is the latest build and then run:
```sh
npm install
```
## Peer dependencies

Make sure the peer dependency libraries, specified in the [package.json](https://github.com/elyra-ai/canvas/blob/bd10c6b79e60e11954b03d50fcb7ed6de58f0629/canvas_modules/common-canvas/package.json#L117), file are installed as part of the application. The application can use whichever versions of the peer dependencies it wants from those specified.


## Localization

Elyra Canvas text is translated into multple languages. See the [Localization](02.01-localization.md) page for details on how to include that text in the application. In addition, the [text can be customized](02.01-localization.md/#customizing-text-displayed-by-elyra-canvas-componenets) by the application.

## Styling

Elyra Canvas uses components, colors, styles and fonts from the [Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/).

More development information about Carbon components can be found here: https://carbondesignsystem.com/developing/frameworks/react#getting-started

When building an application there are two possible approaches to styling:

* Quick Start using CSS or
* Styling using SASS to allow the application to override colors, styles, etc.

In the examples below, we refer to files in the Elyra Canvas Test Harness which behaves like as a sample application using Common Canvas and Common Properties.

###  Quick Start using CSS

If you just want to get up and running and don't want to customize styles in the interface, just import this regular CSS file:

  - @elyra/canvas/dist/styles/common-canvas.min.css


### Styling using SASS

If you want to use the full power of SASS for styling to override default styling in Common Canvas or Common Properties then you must include this `@forward`  in your SCSS:

```
@forward "@carbon/react" with (
	$font-path: "/fonts/plex",
	$use-per-family-plex: true
);
```

For an example of this, refer to the Elyra Canvas Test Harness files:

* [harness.scss](https://github.com/elyra-ai/canvas/blob/main/canvas_modules/harness/assets/styles/harness.scss) and
* [carbon.scss](https://github.com/elyra-ai/canvas/blob/main/canvas_modules/harness/assets/styles/carbon.scss)

Additionally, to get the IBM Plex fonts to display correctly you must complete the steps in the [Loading Fonts](/02-set-up/#loading-fonts) section below.

When building:

- use `autoprefixer`
- if using webpack, make sure to include the following under the `sass-loader`

    ```js
        options: { includePaths: ["node_modules"] }
    ```

- You can refer to the test harness [webpack.config.dev.js](https://github.com/elyra-ai/canvas/blob/main/canvas_modules/harness/webpack.config.dev.js) for an example.


### Loading Fonts
To get the correct display of fonts in Elyra Canvas, the application's build process should copy the IBM Plex font files from `/node_modules/@ibm`to a `./fonts` folder and the following should be added to the `SCSS` for the application:

```
@use "@ibm/plex-sans-condensed/scss" as PlexSansCondensed with (
	$font-prefix: "/fonts/plex-sans-condensed"
);

@use "@ibm/plex-sans/scss" as PlexSans with (
	$font-prefix: "/fonts/plex-sans"
);

@use "@ibm/plex-serif/scss" as PlexSerif with (
	$font-prefix: "/fonts/plex-serif"
);

@use "@ibm/plex-mono/scss" as PlexMono with (
	$font-prefix: "/fonts/plex-mono"
);

@include PlexSansCondensed.all();

@include PlexSans.all();

@include PlexSerif.all();

@include PlexMono.all();
```

You can see an example of this in the [common.scss](https://github.com/elyra-ai/canvas/blob/main/canvas_modules/harness/assets/styles/common.scss) file for the Elyra Canvas Test Harness.

The [Gruntfile](https://github.com/elyra-ai/canvas/blob/main/canvas_modules/harness/Gruntfile.js#L68) that builds the Test Harness contains the following, that ensures the fonts are copied from `/node_modules/@ibm` to the `<carbon fonts folder>`:
```
copy: {
	fonts: {
		files: [{
			expand: true,
			flatten: false,
			cwd: "./node_modules/@ibm",
			src: ["plex-*/fonts/**"],
			dest: ".build/fonts"
		}]
	}
}
...
var buildTasks = ["copy:fonts"];
```

### 3rd party styling

If you intend to configure Common Properties to use the, now superseded, React-virtualized tables by setting `enableTanstackTable` [configuration](/04.08-properties-config/#properties-config) property to `false` then you will need to also include the react-virtualized styles:

- react-virtualized/styles.css
