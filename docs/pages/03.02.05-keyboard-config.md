# Keyboard Config object

The keyboard config object configures whether certain actions are available from the keyboard when focus is on the flow editor.
See the [Keyboard Support](03.05-keyboard-support.md) section for what key combinations are supported.

```js
    const keyboardConfig = {
       actions: {
          delete: false,
          undo: false,
          redo: false,
          selectAll: false,
          cutToClipboard: false,
          copyToClipboard: false,
          pasteFromClipboard: false
    };
```
All actions are `true` by default so it is only necessary to specify those actions you don't want as `false`.
