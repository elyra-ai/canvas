# Node Customization

Node appearance and behavior can be customized using:

* Setting [Canvas Config fields specific to nodes](03.02.01-canvas-config.md/#nodes)
* Customizing Layout Fields (see below)
* Customizing node colors and styles with CSS (see below)

## Customizing Layout fields

### Node layout fields
Node layout properties define how all the elements of a node are displayed such as: the position and size of the icon image; the position of the main label; even the shape of the node itself.

There are two possible sets of node layout properties provided by Common Canvas, these are controlled by the [`enableNodeFormatType`](03.02.01-canvas-config.md/#enablenodeformattype) canvas configuration property which can be set to either "Horizontal" or "Vertical".

<img src="../assets/cc-node-format.png" width="400" />

### Default values for node layout properties
The possible node layout properties are shown below with the values they have when `enableNodeFormatType = "Horizontal"`. You can see the values for both sets of properties by looking at the [layout-dimensions.js program](https://github.com/elyra-ai/canvas/blob/master/canvas_modules/common-canvas/src/object-model/layout-dimensions.js)

    ellipsisPosX: 145,
    ellipsisPosY: 9,
    ellipsisHoverAreaPadding: 2

    ```

### Node Element positioning

Node elements are positioned on the node as an x/y offset from one of nine positions:

<img src="../assets/cc-node-elements-pos.png" width="350" />

The default for most elements is `topLeft`. The position is useful when nodes are resizeable because, as a node is resized, the element will remain tied to its position. So if, for example, an element is tied to `topRight` and the node is resized to be wider the element will move to remain at the same offset from the `topRight` position.

The PosX and PosY properties for each element is an offset from the associated anchor position where PosX is the number of pixels **to the right** of the anchor position and PosY is a number of pixels **down from** the anchor position. Negative values can be provided to specify an offset **to the left** and **up from** the anchor position.

For example, these settings:
```
    {
        imagePosition: "middleCenter",
        imagePosX: -10,
        imagePosY: -10,
        imageWidth: 20,
        imageHeight: 20
    }
};
```
would position the image 10 pixels left and 10 pixels above the very center of the node. Since the image is 20 x 20 pixels this would position the center of the image at the center of the node. If you have enabled re-sizeable nodes, this would keep the image centrally positioned while the node is being resized by the user. Like this:

<img src="../assets/cc-node-resize.gif" width="150" />

### Overriding the node layout properties for all nodes

If you want to change the appearance of **all** nodes on your canvas you can specify the [`enableNodeLayout`](03.02.01-canvas-config.md/#enablenodelayout) configuration parameter in the canvas configuration object. The properties from this object will replace any properties in the default set, which was chosen based on the settings of `enableNodeFormatType`. So you don't need to provide all of the properties; just the ones you want to replace.

Let's say you want your nodes to be displayed as ellipses. You could provide the following settings in `enableNodeLayout` in the canvas config:
```js
const canvasConfig = {
    enableNodeLayout: {
        bodyPath: "     M  0 30 Q  0  0 60  0 Q 120  0 120 30 Q 120 60 60 60 Q  0 60  0 30 Z",
        selectionPath: "M -5 30 Q -5 -5 60 -5 Q 125 -5 125 30 Q 125 65 60 65 Q -5 65 -5 30 Z",
        defaultNodeWidth: 120,
        defaultNodeHeight: 60,
        imageWidth: 30,
        imageHeight: 30,
        imagePosX: 20,
        imagePosY: 10,
        labelEditable: true,
        labelPosX: 60,
        labelPosY: 37,
        labelWidth: 90,
        labelHeight: 17, // Should match the font size specified in CSS + padding
        ellipsisDisplay: true,
        ellipsisPosX: 100,
        ellipsisPosY: 20,
        portPosY: 30
    }
};
```

### Overriding the node layout fields for individual nodes or groups of nodes

If you want each node, or category of nodes, to have a different layout based on some criteria you can use the [layoutHandler callback method](03.03-callbacks.md#layouthandler). When you specify this callback method to Common Canvas, it will be called for each node on the canvas, during initialization and, occasionally, at other times.

The method should return a simple JavaScript object that contains any node layout properties you want to override from the defaults and the ones specified in the `enableNodeLayout` field in the canvas config.

!!! info

    There are three levels of properties provided where each overrides the previous set:

    1. First Common Canvas takes the full default set of node layout fields based on the value for `enableNodeFormatType`.
    2. Next Common Canvas overrides these with the fields from the `enableNodeLayout` object in the canvas config, if any are provided.
    3. Finally, Common Canvas overrides the combined set with any fields from the object returned from the `layoutHandler` method if one is specified, for the node in question.

The callback is provided with a `data` parameter which is the node object from the pipelineFlow so your code can examine the node object and return node layout properties as appropriate.

!!! tip
    The `layoutHandler` callback is called while the canvas is being displayed, therefore it must return very quickly each time it is called otherwise your canvas display speed will be slowed down.

Here is a simple example of a `layoutHandler` callback method which will override the width of the node based on the width of the main label for any node where the node's `op` field is set to `Sort`:
```js
layoutHandler(data) {
	let customNodeLayout = {};
	if (data.op === "Sort") {
		const labLen = data.label ? data.label.length : 0;
		const width = (labLen * 9) + 30; // Allow 9 pixels for each character and a bit extra for padding
		customNodeLayout = {
			defaultNodeWidth: width // Override default width with calculated width
		};
	}
	return customNodeLayout;
```

## Overriding port positions and link directions

The four options for [enableLinkDirection](03.02.01-canvas-config.md/#enablelinkdirection) canvas config ("LeftRight", "RightLeft", "TopBottom" and "BottomTop") will control the default position of the input and output ports at the boundaries of the nodes as follows:

* For "LeftRight" output ports will be on the right of the node and input ports will be on the left of the node
* For "RightLeft" output ports will be on the left of the node and input ports will be on the right of the node
* For "TopBottom" output ports will be on the bottom of the node and input ports will be on the top of the node
* For "BottomTop" output ports will be on the top of the node and input ports will be on the bottom of the node


The application can customize these default position of the ports using the `enableNodeLayout` object in the canvas config. This object has these fields:

* `inputPortAutoPosition` and `inputPortPositions` to customize input ports and
* `outputPortAutoPosition` and `outputPortPositions` to customize output ports.

So for example, with the following settings
```js
    const config = {
        enableNodeLayout: {
            inputPortAutoPosition: false,
            inputPortPositions: [
                { x_pos: 0, y_pos: 5, pos: "topLeft" },
                { x_pos: 0, y_pos: -5, pos: "bottomLeft" }
            ]
        }
    };
```
will position the input ports like this

<img src="../assets/cc-node-port-custom.png" width="100" />

If nodes are set to be resizeable (enableResizeableNodes: true) and the nodes is resized it will look like this, because the second port is tied to the "bottomLeft" position:

<img src="../assets/cc-node-port-custom-resize.png" width="100" />

When ports are positioned on the node regardless of whether they are positioned by default or have customized positions, they are assigned one of four 'directions' that links will be drawn from/to. These directions are dependent on the diagonal quadrant of the node the port is positioned within.

As an extreme example, if these fields are used to customize a node with four input ports (black circles) and four output ports (blue arrows) like this:

<img src="../assets/cc-link-multi-ports.png" width="200" />

Common Canvas will assign a direction to the input and output ports are follows:

<img src="../assets/cc-link-multi-ports-quadrants.png" width="200" />

If the config field [enableLinkMethod](03.02.01-canvas-config.md#enablelinkmethod) is set to "Ports", and [enableLinkType](03.02.01-canvas-config.md#enablelinktype) is set to "Curve", the links will be drawn as follows:

<img src="../assets/cc-link-multi-ports-connected.png" width="350" />

Note that the same technique is used to assign port 'directions' to the ports of the surrounding nodes as well as the center node.

This means an application like the one shown below can be built, where the links exit from the left of the 'Inp_1' node and point to the 'Stage Variables' node below it, but other links exist the 'Inp_1' node on the right and point to the 'Out_2'. This is achieved by positioning some (invisible) output nodes on the left of 'Inp_1' and some on the right of 'Inp_1'. Common Canvas takes care of drawing the links in the appropriate direction based on the port positions.

<img src="../assets/cc-link-mapping-transformer.png" width="900" />

## Node image as a URL

[Images](01.01.01-nodes.md/#node-image) are displayed for the nodes in the flow editor canvas and the palette. The internal definition of a node in the pipeline flow object and palette object are exactly the same.

Typically, the [image field](https://github.com/elyra-ai/pipeline-schemas/blob/90e436eda2c153c6026c0d649fc6adfece004951/common-pipeline/pipeline-flow/pipeline-flow-ui-v3-schema.json#L136) of a node object in the pipeline flow (or palette) is a URL that references an image file on the server. This can be any type of image that can be displayed in an `<image>` tag however, if the file is recognized as an SVG file by having the `.svg` extension, the contents of the file will be loaded as inline SVG in the DOM. This allows more image customization using CSS.

The management of images can be controlled using the [`enableImageDisplay`](03.02.01-canvas-config.md/#enableimagedisplay) canvas config field.

!!! note "Data URLs"
    [Data URLs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URLs) can be used to embed an image file within the pipeline flow JSON however, this is not recommended for production use since it leads to bloated pipeline flow files because of the amount of data stored for each image and the repetition of images across multiple nodes of the same type.

!!! note "Alternative palette image"
    The node definition contains a [palette image field](https://github.com/elyra-ai/pipeline-schemas/blob/90e436eda2c153c6026c0d649fc6adfece004951/common-pipeline/pipeline-flow/pipeline-flow-ui-v3-schema.json#L208n) which, if specified, will be displayed as the node's image only on the palette.

## Node image as JSX

Images can also be provided to Common Canvas as JSX objects. This means, for example, that the application can provide [Carbon icons](https://carbondesignsystem.com/elements/icons/library) as node images in the palette and on the canvas. Since JSX objects cannot be stringified, the application must programmatically set the node image field to reference the appropriate JSX object.

Also, when data is retrieved from Common Canvas using either `canvasController.getPipelineFlow()` or `canvasController.getPaletteData()`, the returned node object will not contain any image information.

The node image can be set something like this (where "123" is the node Id):

```js
    import { JoinInner } from “@carbon/react/icons”:
    ...
    ...
    canvasController.setNodeProperties("123", { image: (<JoinInner size={20} />) });
```
Alternatively, JSX images can be injected directly into the pipeline flow object or palette object before it is provided to Common Canvas.

!!! note "Size prop"
    Note, the `size` prop is used when the icon is displayed in the palette however in the node the icon will be sized based on the `imageHeight` and `imageWidth` fields in the nodeLayout object specified in the `enableNodeLayout` field of the canvas config object.

Also, when nodes are pasted into the canvas the application will need to ensure the image fields of those nodes are set appropriately.

A new sample application called ‘JSX Icons’ has been added to the test harness to show Carbon icons being used as node images.

## Customizing node colors and styles with CSS

### Node DOM Construction

Node elements are drawn as SVG elements in the SVG area provided by the [Flow Editor](01.01-flow-editor.md) and are grouped together using a group `<g>` element.

<img src="../assets/cc-node-elements-dom.png" width="800" />

The DOM elements that make up a node can be customized using CSS styles. This is done by either overriding the common-canvas CSS directly or, if customization is needed on a node-by-node basis, by assigning a class name to the group `<g>` element that is the container for all the node elements. The class can be applied to the group object in a number of different ways:

1. By specifying it in the `app_data.ui_data.class_name` field of the node in the pipeline flow document that is provided to Common Canvas using `CanvasController.setPipelineFlow(pFlow)`
2. By specifying it using the following API methods:
    * CanvasController.setNodeProperties(nodeId, properties, pipelineId)
    * CanvasController.setNodesClassName(nodeIds, newClassName, pipelineId)
3. By specifying a class name in the `className` field of the node layout properties in the canvas config. Like this
```
const canvasConfig = {
    enableNodeLayout: {
        className: "my-node-class"
    }
};
```
4. By specifying a class name in the `className` field of the node layout properties returned from the `layoutHandler`.


You can see the [svg-canvas-d3.scss file](https://github.com/elyra-ai/canvas/blob/main/canvas_modules/common-canvas/src/common-canvas/svg-canvas-d3.scss) for full details about what elements in the node can be styled but here are a list of some basic parts of the node:


### Classes


| Purpose      | DOM tag                             | Classes      | Notes                            |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------- | :---------- | :----------------------------------- |
|Group	        | g | d3-node-group |	Classes specified for the node in the class_name field of the node object will be added here. |
|⮕ Selection area|	path |	d3-node-selection-highlight	| |
|⮕ Outline shape	| path |	d3-node-body-outline |	 |
|⮕ Image	| svg |	d3-node-image |	 |
|⮕ Label	| foreignObject |	d3-foreign-object-node-label |	Will contain a div that contains the label text |
|⮕ Input port	| g |	d3-node-port-input |	 |
|⮕ Output port	| g |	d3-node-port-output |	 |
|⮕ Decorations	| g |	d3-node-decorations-group |	Will contain decoration elements, for example, image, path etc |


So for example if you want the node body (the rectangle) to be colored orange you would provide a class name to the group element using one of the techniques mentioned above and then put this in you CSS:

```
.my-node-class .d3-node-body-outline {
   fill: orange;
}
```
Note: You can use the [`enableParentClass`](03.02.01-canvas-config.md#enableparentclass) canvas config field to make you CSS rulesets specific so your styles are picked up in preference to the common-canvas default styles.
