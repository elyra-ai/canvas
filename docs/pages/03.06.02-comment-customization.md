# Comment Customization

Comments can be customized by the application in the following ways:

* Setting the [enableMarkdownInComments](03.02.01-canvas-config.md/#enablemarkdownincomments) field in the canvas configuration.
* Customizing comment appearance with CSS (see below).


## Customizing comment appearance with CSS

### Comment DOM Construction

Comment elements are drawn as SVG elements in the SVG area provided by the [Flow Editor](01.01-flow-editor.md) and are grouped together using a group `<g>` element.

The DOM elements that make up a comment can be customized using CSS styles. This is done by either overriding the common-canvas CSS directly or, if customization is needed on a comment-by-comment basis, by assigning a class name to the group `<g>` element that is the container for all the comment elements. The class can be applied to the group object in a number of different ways:

1. By specifying it in the `app_data.ui_data.class_name` field of the comment in the pipeline flow document that is provided to Common Canvas using `CanvasController.setPipelineFlow(pFlow)`
2. By specifying it using the following API methods:
    * CanvasController.setCommentProperties(commentId, properties, pipelineId)
    * CanvasController.setCommentsClassName(commentIds, newClassName, pipelineId)

You can see the [svg-canvas-d3.scss file](https://github.com/elyra-ai/canvas/blob/main/canvas_modules/common-canvas/src/common-canvas/svg-canvas-d3.scss) for full details about what elements in the comment can be styled but here are a list of some basic parts of the comment:


### Classes

| Purpose      | DOM tag                             | Classes      | Notes                            |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------- | :---------- | :----------------------------------- |
|Group	        | g | d3-comment-group |	Classes specified for the comment in the class_name field of the node object will be added here. |
|⮕ Sizing area|	path |	d3-comment-sizing	| |
|⮕ Selection area|	path |	d3-comment-selection-highlight	| |
|⮕ Background	| path |	d3-comment-rect |	 |
|⮕ Text	| foreignObject |	d3-foreign-object-comment-text |	Will contain a div that contains the comment text |
|⮕ Decorations	| g |	d3-comment-decorations-group |	Will contain decoration elements, for example, image, path etc |


Note: You can use the [`enableParentClass`](03.02.01-canvas-config.md#enableparentclass) canvas config field to make you CSS rulesets specific so your styles are picked up in preference to the common-canvas default styles.
