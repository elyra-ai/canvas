# Flow Editor Overview

The Flow Editor displays the flow to the user and allows the user to interact with the flow using the mouse/trackpad and the keyboard and other input devices. Typically, the flow shows a set of nodes connected by links (edges) that represent some flow of data, or flow of control, which is in the problem domain of the application.

The editor displays the following object types which the user can interact with:

* [Nodes](01.01.01-nodes.md)
* [Links](01.01.02-links.md)
* [Comments](01.01.03-comments.md)
* [Decorations](01.01.04-decorations.md)

## Pipeline Flow

The defintions of objects displayed within the flow editor are contained in a JavaScript object descibed by the [pipeline flow schema](https://github.com/elyra-ai/pipeline-schemas/blob/main/common-pipeline/pipeline-flow/pipeline-flow-v3-schema.json). A pipeline flow object can be serialized to, or parsed from, JSON and consequently saved to, or read from, a file.

The storage and mangement of pipeline flow files is handled by the application. The pipeline flow can be read from the canvas controller:

```js
    const pflow - canvasController.getPipelineFlow();
```
and a previously saved pipeline flow can be provided to common-canvas also using the canvas controller:

```js
    canvasController.setPipelineFlow(pFlow);
```

## Create nodes

Nodes can be created by dragging from the palette and dropping onto the flow editor canvas:

## Create links

Links can be created by dragging from one node's output port to another node:

## Reposition Objects

The Flow Editor allows direct manipulation of selected objects by dragging them to a new position.
