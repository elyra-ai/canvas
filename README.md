## elyra/canvas

## Overview
The Common Canvas tooling consists of two Node JS modules:

1) A `Common Canvas` for use in building canvas-like applications. See [detailed API and event documentation](https://github.com/elyra-ai/canvas/tree/main/canvas_modules/common-canvas).

2) `Test harness`  
See [here](https://github.com/elyra-ai/canvas/tree/main/canvas_modules/harness) for setting up local environment

## Using local version of common-canvas and/or common-properties
Clone elyra/canvas
```sh
git clone git@github.com:elyra-ai/canvas.git
# install global libraries for building
npm install -g grunt-cli sass
# Build common-canvas and common-properties
./<elyra/canvas>/canvas_modules/common-canvas/build.sh
```
In your application's package.json replace  
```
"@elyra/canvas": "<verson>"
```
with
```  
"@elyra/canvas": "file:<elyra/canvas>/canvas_modules/common-canvas"
```

Delete @elyra/canvas from node_modules of your application

```sh
# Run npm install to get local copy of common-canvas and/or common-properties
npm install
```
