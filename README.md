## elyra/canvas

## Overview
The Elyra Canvas tooling consists of two Node JS modules:

1) A `Common Canvas` for use in building canvas-like applications. See [detailed API and event documentation](https://github.com/elyra-ai/canvas/tree/main/canvas_modules/common-canvas).

2) `Test harness`
See [here](https://github.com/elyra-ai/canvas/tree/main/canvas_modules/harness) for setting up local environment
