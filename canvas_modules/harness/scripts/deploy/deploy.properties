#
# This file contains the definition of properties to be bound to the application as part of the deployment
# process.
#
# Properties use this naming convention:
# [ cf env (ys1, yp) ]_[ space (dev, qa, prod) ]=[ property value ]
#
# During deployment, these properties are bound to the application using the "cf set-env" command.  For example,
# ys1_dev_STAGE=TMPSTAGE binds the environment variable "STAGE" with the value of "TMPSTAGE" during the ys1
# dev deployment.
#
# Secure parameters can be defined as Travis environment variables and referenced here using shell variables,
# i.e. ${[var name]}
#
# The following variables are passed to the deployment script and can be referenced for application binding:
# CF_API -- the api of the targeted deployment (i.e. api.stage1.ng.bluemix.net for YS1 Dallas)
# CF_ORG -- the organization of the targeted deployment (i.e. CDSX)
# CF_SPACE -- the space of the targeted deployment (i.e. dev)
# CF_DOMAIN -- the domain of the targeted deployment (i.e. stage1.ng.bluemix.net)
