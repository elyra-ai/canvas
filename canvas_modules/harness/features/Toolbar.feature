Feature: Toolbar

	** Make sure the test harness is running and listening to http://localhost:3001 ***

	As a human
	I want to test secondaryToolbar operations
	So I can build a canvas and perform secondaryToolbar operations

	Scenario: Sanity test for secondary toolbar Cut and Paste buttons
		Then I resize the window size to 1400 width and 800 height

		Given I am on the test harness
		Given I have uploaded palette "modelerPalette.json"
		Given I have uploaded diagram "commentColorCanvas.json"

		# Test cutting some nodes and a comment and paste to canvas
		Then I validate there are 8 links on the canvas with port style
		Then I click the comment with text " comment 1" to select it
		Then I Ctrl/Cmnd+click the "DRUG1n" node to add it to the selections
		Then I Ctrl/Cmnd+click the "Na_to_K" node to add it to the selections
		Then I Ctrl/Cmnd+click the "Discard Fields" node to add it to the selections
		Then I click the cut button on the toolbar
		Then I click the paste button on the toolbar
		Then I verify the number of nodes are 6
		Then I verify the number of comments are 3
		 # There are 7 links because a data link has disappeared during the cut and paste
		Then I validate there are 7 links on the canvas with port style

	Scenario: Sanity test for secondary toolbar Copy and Paste buttons
		Then I resize the window size to 1400 width and 800 height

		Given I am on the test harness
		Given I have uploaded palette "modelerPalette.json"

		Then I Ctrl/Cmnd+click the "C5.0" node to add it to the selections
		Then I Ctrl/Cmnd+click the "Neural Net" node to add it to the selections
		Then I click the copy button on the toolbar
		Then I click the paste button on the toolbar
		Then I verify the number of nodes are 9
		Then I verify the number of comments are 4
		 # There are 12 links because 2 new data link and 2 new comment links were created during the copy and paste
		Then I validate there are 12 links on the canvas with port style

	Scenario: Sanity test for secondary toolbar Create and Delete button
		Then I resize the window size to 1400 width and 800 height

		Given I am on the test harness
		Given I have uploaded palette "modelerPalette.json"

		Then I edit the comment "" with text "New Comment"
		Then I double click the "Define Types" node to open its properties
		Then I click the overflow button on the toolbar
		Then I click the delete button on the toolbar
		Then I verify the number of nodes are 5
		Then I select all the comments in the canvas
		Then I click the delete button on the toolbar
		Then I verify the number of comments are 0

	Scenario: Sanity test for secondary toolbar resize
		Then I resize the window size to 1400 width and 800 height

		Given I am on the test harness
		Given I have uploaded palette "modelerPalette.json"
		Given I have uploaded diagram "commentColorCanvas.json"

		Then I resize the window size to 500 width and 600 height
		Then I verify the number of items in the secondary toolbar are 10
		Then I resize the window size to 540 width and 600 height
		Then I verify the number of items in the secondary toolbar are 11
		Then I resize the window size to 580 width and 600 height
		Then I verify the number of items in the secondary toolbar are 12
		Then I resize the window size to 620 width and 600 height
		Then I verify the number of items in the secondary toolbar are 13
		Then I resize the window size to 660 width and 600 height
