Feature: Tips

	** Make sure the test harness is running and listening to http://localhost:3001 ***

	As a human
	I want to test tips for nodes, ports, links and the palette
	So I can get information when hovering over elements

	Scenario: Sanity test to check if tips show up for the palette, nodes, ports and links
		Then I resize the window size to 1400 width and 800 height
		Given I am on the test harness
		Given I have uploaded palette "modelerPalette.json"
		Given I have uploaded diagram "multiPortsCanvas.json"

		Then I open the palette

		Then I hover over category "Import"
		Then I verify the tip shows next to category "Import"

		Then I hover over node type "Var. File" in category "Import"
		Then I verify the tip shows next to the node type "Var. File" in category "Import"

		Then I move the mouse to coordinates 300, 100
		Then I verify the tip doesn't show for node type "Var. File"

		Then I hover over the node "Define Types"
		Then I verify the tip shows "below" the node "Define Types"

		Then I move the mouse to coordinates 300, 100
		Then I verify the tip doesn't show for node "Define Types"

		Then I hover over the input port "inPort2" of node "Define Types"
		Then I verify the port name "Input Port 2" shows below the input port id "inPort2" of node "Define Types"

		Then I move the mouse to coordinates 300, 100
		Then I verify the tip doesn't show for input port id "inPort2"

		Then I hover over the link at 420, 260
		Then I verify the tip shows below 260 for link between node "Discard Fields", port "Output Port Two" and node "Define Types", port "Input Port 2"

		Then I move the mouse to coordinates 300, 100
		Then I verify the tip shows doesn't show for link

	Scenario: Sanity test to check if tips don't show up for the palette, nodes, ports and links after disabling tips
		Then I resize the window size to 1400 width and 800 height

		Given I am on the test harness

		Then I open the palette
		Then I hover over node type "Var. File" in category "Import"
		Then I verify the tip doesn't show for node type "Var. File"

		Then I hover over the node "Define Types"
		Then I verify the tip doesn't show for node "Define Types"

		Then I hover over the input port "inPort2" of node "Define Types"
		Then I verify the tip doesn't show for input port id "inPort2"

		Then I hover over the link at 420, 260
		Then I verify the tip shows doesn't show for link

		And I enter "New Port Label" into the new label field
		And I call the API by clicking on the Submit button
		Then I hover over the output port "outPort2" of node "Discard Fields"
		And I verify the port name "New Port Label" shows below the output port id "outPort2" of node "Discard Fields"

	Scenario: Sanity test tip location adjusted based on boundaries of canvas
		Then I resize the window size to 1400 width and 800 height

		Given I am on the test harness

		# Create a supernode
		Then I click the "Discard Fields" node to select it
		Then I Ctrl/Cmnd+click the "Define Types" node to add it to the selections
		Then I right click the "Define Types" node to display the context menu
		Then I click option "Create supernode" from the context menu

		# Check the collapsed supernode shows a tip
		Then I hover over the node "Supernode"

		# Expand the supernode
		Then I right click the "Supernode" node to display the context menu
		Then I click option "Expand supernode" from the context menu

		# Check the expanded supernode shows a tip
		Then I hover over the node "Supernode"
		And I verify the tip shows "below" the node "Supernode"

		# Check one of the nodes in the subflow shows a tip
		Then I hover over the node "Discard Fields" in the subflow
		And I verify the tip shows "below" the node "Discard Fields" in the subflow

		# Check the other node in the subflow shows a tip
		Then I hover over the node "Define Types" in the subflow
