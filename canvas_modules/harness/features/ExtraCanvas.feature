	Feature: ExtraCanvas

	** Make sure the test harness is running and listening to http://localhost:3001 ***

	As a human
	I want test extra canvas operations
	So I can build a extra canvas and perform node operations

	Scenario: Sanity test to perform extra canvas node operation
		Then I resize the window size to 1400 width and 800 height

		Given I am on the test harness
		Given I have set this canvas config ""{"selectedExtraCanvasDisplayed": true}""
		Given I have uploaded palette for extra canvas "modelerPalette.json"
		Given I have uploaded diagram for extra canvas "modelerCanvas.json"

		Then I verify the number of nodes in extra canvas are 8

		Then I open the extra canvas palette
		Then I add node 7 a "Filler" node from the "Field Ops" category onto the extra canvas at 380, 480
		Then I close the palette
		Then I verify the number of nodes in extra canvas are 9

		Given I have toggled the app side panel
		Then I drag the Derive Node from side panel to extra canvas at 380, 480
		Given I have toggled the app side panel
		Then I verify the number of nodes in extra canvas are 10

		Then I delete node 1 the "Define Types" node from extra canvas
		Then I verify the number of nodes in extra canvas are 9

		Then I delete node 2 the "Derive" node from extra canvas
		Then I verify the number of nodes in extra canvas are 8

	Scenario: Sanity test to perform extra canvas property edit operation
		Then I resize the window size to 1400 width and 800 height

		Given I am on the test harness
		Given I have set this canvas config ""{"selectedExtraCanvasDisplayed": true}""
		Given I have uploaded diagram "commentColorCanvas.json"
		Given I have uploaded palette for extra canvas "modelerPalette.json"
		Given I have uploaded diagram for extra canvas "modelerCanvas.json"

		Then I double click the "C5.0" node to open its properties
		Then I enter "10" in the "samplingRatio" field in "top" canvas
		Then I double click the "Define Types" node to open its properties in extra canvas
		Then I enter "25" in the "samplingRatio" field in "extra" canvas
