This directory contains some schema files which are slightly different to the
schema files in the @ai-workspace/canvas-schemas module (which is built from the
wdp-pipeline-schemas repo). The reason they are different is that the
runtime validation code needs them to be different so that validation
works successfully. They contain syntactical changes rather than semantic
changes.

These files, referred to by the schema-validator.js program, should be
left in-place until such time as we know that no customer is ever going
to want to upgrade from a v1 or v2 pipelineFlow to the latest version.
