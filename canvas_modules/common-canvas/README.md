## elyra/canvas
The `Common Canvas` exists for use in building canvas-like applications. The canvas is driven by an application-agnostic [PipelineFlow JSON](https://github.com/elyra-ai/pipeline-schemas/tree/main/common-pipeline/pipeline-flow), and fires UI events to the consuming application for document management.
