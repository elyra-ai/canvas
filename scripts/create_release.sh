# Add github to known hosts
# Note: ssh returns non-zero code because github doesn't support shell access.
# We don't care about this... but because we use -e option at the top
# of the script, it fails the script completely.
# This is a workaround so that this command doesnt hit the fail-on-error stuff.
# - Thought we could have used the other trick: <cmd> || true
set +e # Disable error checking

# only create the release if this is a travis cron job.
